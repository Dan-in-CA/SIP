Proto Plugin</H2>
<P>The proto plugin is designed as a starting point for creating new
plugins for SIP. It does not perform any useful action but contains
the basic components necessary for a functioning plugin.</P>
<P>The plugin includes the folowing files:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><STRONG>proto.py</STRONG><BR>The
	python program that does the actual work of the plugin. Location:
	<STRONG>SIP/plugins</STRONG></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><STRONG>proto.html</STRONG><BR>A
	web.py template that provides a user interface for the plugin. It
	includes both Python code and web page markup. Location:
	<STRONG>SIP/templates</STRONG></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><STRONG>proto-docs.html</STRONG><BR>This
	file. Provides documentation for the plugin including any special hardware needed and set up instructions. Location:
	<STRONG>SIP/static/docs/plugins</STRONG></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><STRONG>proto.manifest</STRONG><BR>A
	simple text file containing a list of each of the plugin&rsquo;s
	files with the path to it&rsquo;s location. The manifest is used by
	the plugin manager to install and uninstall the plugin. The file
	can also contain information about the plugin such as author, brief description, requirements, etc.
	Location: <STRONG>SIP/plugins/manifest</STRONG></P>
	<LI><P><STRONG>proto.json</STRONG><BR>An optional file used for
	persistant storage of plugin settings. It is created by the plugin
	the first time it is run and is not installed with the other files.
	This allows for software updates without overwriting existing
	settings. Location: <STRONG>SIP/data</STRONG></P>
</UL>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="using-the-proto-plugin"></A>Using the
proto plugin</H2>
<P>This plugin is disabled by default. If you are reading this, the
proto plugin is probably enabled on your system. Otherwise you can
enable it using the plugin manager or by setting the group
permissions of the <STRONG>proto.py</STRONG> file to <STRONG>executable</STRONG>.
Once it is enabled, and the SIP program has been restarted, You can
verify it is working by selecting it from the PLUGINS drop down menu
of the main program&rsquo;s web interface. You should be taken to the
plugin&rsquo;s Settings page.</P>
<P>To begin creating a new plugin from proto you will need to
copy/rename each of the proto files you will be using in your
project. For example, on the command line, you can make a copy of the
proto.py file with a new name:</P>
<PRE CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><CODE CLASS="western">sudo cp SIP/plugins/proto.py SIP/plugins/your-new-name.py</CODE></PRE><P>
Follow a similar procedure for the other files you will include in
your project.</P>
<P>The next step is to open your new Python file and edit the items
in the following list. See comments in the file for more information.</P>
<P>Edit these items:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">URLs for plugin pages</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Name of plugin to be shown on
	plugins menu</P>
	<LI><P>Name of .json file for storing settings (optional)</P>
</UL>
<P>After you make the changes and save the file, check that the group
permission of the file is exicutable.</P>
<PRE CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><CODE CLASS="western">sudo ls -l SIP/plugins/your-new-name.py</CODE></PRE><P>
The first column of the line for your plugin should look something
like <CODE CLASS="western">-rw-r-xr-- 1</CODE>. The x preceding the
third r is what counts.</P>
<P>If you need to change the setting you can use the plugin manager
or the command:</P>
<PRE CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><CODE CLASS="western">sudo chmod g+x SIP/plugins/your-new-name.py</CODE></PRE><P>
to enable the plugin or:</P>
<PRE CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><CODE CLASS="western">sudo chmod g-x SIP/plugins/your-new-name.py</CODE></PRE><P>
to disable it without affecting any other permissions.</P>
<P>Restart the SIP program and you should be able to access your new
plugin from the menu. If you entered a new name for the <STRONG>proto.json</STRONG>
file it should appear in the <STRONG>SIP/data</STRONG> directory
after you access your plugin for the first time.</P>
<P>If there is an error when you try to access your plugin, start the
SIP program manually.<BR>In the <STRONG>SIP directory</STRONG>
issue the following command:</P>
<PRE CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><CODE CLASS="western">sudo python sip.py</CODE></PRE><P>
You will now be able to see messages from the program that can help
you figure out what went wrong.</P>
