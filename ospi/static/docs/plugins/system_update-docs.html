    <h1>OSPi System updater plugin</h1>
    <p>This plugin compares the local OSPi version with the GitHub repository
      and can update the local software.</p>
    <p>It fetches version information from the GitHub OSPi repository when the
      plugin is opened. This may take several seconds to complete depending on
      the speed of your internet connection.</p>
    <p>You should then be presented with information about whether a new version
      of the software is available and what changes have been made.</p>
    <h3>To update OSPi</h3>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Click the "UPDATE OSPI" button at the lower left of the screen</li>
      <li>If the Home screen does not appear after several seconds, click your
        browser's refresh button.</li>
    </ul>
    When you have been returned to the home screen, you should see the latest
    version number and date in the page footer.<br>
