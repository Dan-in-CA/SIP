??Vars held in the settings dict (gv.sd), default values shown

from controller values (cvalues):

nprogs:0 number of programs (can be calculated form length of prog array)
mo:[0] master operation bytes - contains bits per board for stations with master set
ir:[0] ignore rain bytes - contains bits per board for stations to ignore rain delay and rain sensor
rsn:0 Reset all stations
nst:8 number of stations

for logging:
lg:0 log runs if = "checked"
lr:100 limit number of log records to keep, 0 = no limit

other gv attributes:
